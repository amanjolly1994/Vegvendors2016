				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>Sometimes ago, we planned to work on something innovative and beneficial for the society
 by using our mind, skills, technology, innovations and teamwork. This gave birth to the idea of <b>VegVendors</b>.
				</p><br><br>		
		<p>

				The idea of VegVendors struck us when we saw few vendors sitting 
under some shed in the noon time, waiting for their customers while the customers i.e. common people like us
 were sitting in our air-conditioned rooms ordering vegetables online. On seeing this, we realized that how many 
such facilities have created problems for such vendors in earning their daily needs. Vendors are those poor people
 who chose to earn for themselves and their families through hard work and only customers can help him in doing so.
				
				</p><br<br>

<p>		Technology has been a boon for our lives and we have just tried to make it
 useful for vegetable vendors who are digitally illiterate also. Our team pondered over the thought of helping veg 
vendors and customers and has put all our efforts to make our dream work and get a real picture.


</p><br><br>
<p>
	Not only vegetable vendors will get more opportunities to sell their vegetables but also they will 
learn how to use technology to make better use of it. As well as customers will get fresh and healthy vegetables 
at their doorsteps at reasonable rates.
</P><br><br>
<p>

	Our team faced many challenges while implementing the idea like convincing the vegetable vendors and 
take them under trust, explaining them about our idea. We also faced challenges like how would we ensure that our customers
 would get right product from the vegetable vendors in less time, and many more. But at the end, we worked hard on solving such 
problems and came up with an actual hyper local delivery model.
</p><br><br>
<p>

	So, here we are<br>
	We are offering our customers with the best quality vegetable sitting at home by the nearby vendors of his/her area. 
We are building a strong relationship between customers and vendors so that they can serve each other in a better way.
</P>
